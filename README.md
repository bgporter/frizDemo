# frizDemo

A demo app of the `friz` animation control system for JUCE. 

The `friz` JUCE module itself is maintained separately (used here as a git 
submodule) and can be found at https://github.com/bgporter/animator.


Both JUCE and `friz` are incorporated here as submodules; to bring them into your local workspace, either:

1. clone this repository
2. run `git submodule init`
3. run `git submodule update`

or just pass the `--recurse-submodules` option to `git clone` when cloning the repo initially.
